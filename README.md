# Shimenawa
Non-photo-realistically rendered scene using Raymarching and SDFs, meaning that everything you see is procedural! Most surfaces are implicitly defined, with clouds being based on physically-based volume rendering techniques, adjusted for artistic control. 

Inspired from Genshin Impact's main menu and 'slumbering court' locale.
